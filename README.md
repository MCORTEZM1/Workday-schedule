# Work Day Schedule

Hello world!!! Welcome to my Workday-schedule. 
Here you can plan out your day by building a personal schedule, tracking your regular business hours 9am-5pm. 

Input your task in the textfield and click the save button to have the task saved on refresh and window close. Hours are tracked by color, where each color denotes whether the time has passed, is in the future, or if it is the current hour; colored grey, green, and red respectively. 

The application is set to audit the tasks automatically every 30 mins, so if you work with the tab open, the time colors will be updated without having to worry about refreshing the page. 


You will find this application to be a practical day planner to help you get through your busy schedule! 


Enjoy,
